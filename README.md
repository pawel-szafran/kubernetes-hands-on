# Hands on Kubernetes

Materials for my _Hands on Kubernetes_ session at UBS Coding Harbor meetup.

## What to bring?

To make the session run smoothly, please bring a laptop with:
- working Internet connection
- Git
- Docker
  - and run [pull-docker-images.sh](pull-docker-images.sh) to save on downloads during the session
- your favorite text editor
- (OPTIONAL) your favorite Docker-ready tech-stack for building services with some REST API

See you on Thursday!
